# Judgment on the Fundamental Boundaries of Transformer Architecture and Continual Learning

## Background

Target Questions:
Is it possible to achieve human-intelligence level continual learning on the existing Transformer architecture?
And: Does global gradient descent constitute a fundamental obstacle, making it mandatory to replace Transformers?

## Core Judgments

1. Within the Transformer framework, it is entirely possible to achieve continual learning capabilities that are "significantly superior to LLMs of the same class."
2. However, "native Transformer + full-parameter global SGD" is unlikely to achieve human-intelligence level continual learning.
3. It is not necessarily essential to completely replace Transformers; a more realistic direction is to use the Transformer as a slow-learning skeleton while layering on new learning mechanisms (fast memory, modular writing, offline consolidation).

## First-Principles Explanation

- The true bottleneck is not the attention operator, but the learning mechanism of "monolithic shared parameters + global synchronous writing."
- In non-stationary data streams, global gradient writing inherently introduces parameter interference, leading to stability-plasticity conflict.
- Theoretically, it is not impossible under conditions of infinite compute and infinite replay; however, under realistic resource constraints, it remains a fundamental obstacle at the practical level.

## Layered Conclusions

- For near-term prototype goals (small models, stronger learning capability at the same class): Transformers do not need to be replaced; prioritize hybrid solutions.
- For long-term goals (human-level, open-world, long-term autonomous continual learning): It is highly probable that the learning paradigm (local plasticity, dynamic topology, sleep-like consolidation) will need to be upgraded simultaneously; whether to completely abandon Transformers is still pending evidence.

## Falsifiable Directions

The next steps should be verified through unified-skeleton comparative experiments, rather than remaining at the level of opinions:

1. Pure full-parameter SGD baseline.
2. Fast-slow dual system (online fast writing + offline consolidation).
3. Modular writing and controlled capacity expansion.

Value should be judged using the following metrics:

- Learning speed of new tasks
- Retention rate of old tasks
- Degree of forgetting (e.g., BWT)
- Computational cost per unit update
