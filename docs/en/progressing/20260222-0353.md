# The Core Dilemma of Continual Learning: Searching for the Missing Puzzles in the Era of Parameter Updates

_The following content provides deep reflection on why "Continual Learning in Parametric Space" within the field of deep learning has been struggling._

## Core Premise: Evasion vs. Facing

Currently, AI continual learning is divided into two distinct routes:

1. **Engineering Add-ons (Evasion)**: Token-level context management such as RAG and MemGPT, along with various working memory and agent workflows. These attempt to bypass the catastrophic forgetting inherently present in underlying network weights, achieving "memory" entirely through system-level scheduling. Essentially, this out-sources learning to media like databases, gaining so-called "retrieval" at the cost of extremely high computational overhead for context, rather than achieving "learning" in its essence.
2. **Direct-Facing**: Returning to the core of mathematical computation and weight networks to attempt conquering large-scale, conflict-free, lifelong-level parameter updates in the underlying weight matrices, similar to biological "Memory Consolidation" (Sleep Consolidation).

From the intersecting perspectives of neuroscience, information theory, and optimization theory, humanity has actually **missed several fundamental core mechanisms (Missing Puzzles)** in the puzzle of AI. As long as the underlying physical architecture continues to use **dense multiply-add operations based on backpropagation with static weights**, true continuous parameter updates (lifelong learning without catastrophic forgetting) will remain confined to local validations in laboratories.

## Puzzle 1: The Missing Temporal Anchor & State Dependency

In current mainstream deep learning architectures (Transformer / CNN), **parameters have no concept of time and are stateless**.

- **Computational Limitations of AI: Markovian Destructive Updates**  
  Whether using knowledge editing algorithms (e.g., ROME) or CPT fine-tuning, gradient descent (SGD/Adam) only sees the "current loss." The update of a weight during iteration depends solely on the partial derivatives of the data at that moment. It **does not remember that it once became its current value to memorize some old knowledge**. This "globally indiscriminate" update rule inevitably leads it to destroy previously constructed old feature manifolds without any "guilt."
- **Inspirations from the Brain: Synaptic Tagging and Metaplasticity**  
  Neuroscience reveals that synaptic connection strengths in the brain possess a "Meta-history." If a connection participated in the learning of an intense (high-dopamine/high-burstiness) event, the synaptic core is modified and "locked" into a low-plasticity state; only underutilized redundant connections remain in high-plasticity states. In other words, **each parameter "knows" its own responsibility assessment for carrying historical memories**.
- **Future Critical Solutions:**  
  Past attempts (e.g., EWC) added global static importance penalties to artificial networks through the Fisher Information Matrix, which is computationally expensive and inapplicable to dynamic data streams in open domains. We are **extremely lacking a fundamental optimization algorithm that allows each parameter to possess local hidden states such as "Dynamic Viscosity" or "Historical Timestamps."** Truly evolvable networks must be "Stateful Networks."

## Puzzle 2: The Missing Neurogenesis & Dynamic Topology

Our current parameter updates occur within a **rigid architecture with a fixed shape**.

- **Computational Limitations of AI: Capacity Saturation and Multiplexing Collapse**  
  Given a fixed 7B model space, its degrees of freedom are capped. As new knowledge is continuously crammed into the parameter space, the system is forced to let distributed sub-networks represent completely unrelated conceptual information simultaneously. This leads to "Representation Interference" over time. Once capacity is saturated, new and old knowledge erode and degrade each other within the same manifold, resulting in a dual collapse.
- **Inspirations from the Brain: Neurogenesis and Modular Competition**  
  In the brain, **dendritic spines are generated and eliminated constantly, which involves not only changes in signal weights but directly alters the underlying signal graph topology**. More importantly, the brain is extremely sparse and discretely modular. When humans learn a distinctly new skill, the brain does not mobilize all existing synapses; instead, it tends to recruit a cluster of micro-circuits that have not been heavily occupied to form a new representation system.
- **Future Critical Solutions:**  
  This explains why Adapters, LoRA, and MoE (Mixture of Experts) have recently gained significant traction in academia; they attempt task isolation through conditional computation or the mounting of new modules. However, most current module routing is still hard-coded or constrained by fixed gating function designs. What we **truly lack is a network primitive design that can automatically decide whether to "re-purpose/fine-tune old nodes" or "grow new branches (dynamically allocate sparse parameter clusters)" based on the "Surprise / Prediction Error" of the data**.

## Puzzle 3: The Missing Generative Replay & Neocortical Orthogonalization

Knowledge is not crammed in like fragmented, independent building blocks; it requires **deep integration (sewing)** with existing human knowledge graphs and world models, and achieving **orthogonal distribution normalization (orthogonalizing)**.

- **Computational Limitations of AI: Violent Gradient Conflict and Rigid Data Replay**  
  Today, the crudest means to resist forgetting is to establish a "Replay Buffer," continuously mixing a small amount of high-quality old data with new data. This approach is extremely inefficient: not only does it cause permanent engineering resource expansion, but because it only mechanically presents original slices, the model fails to produce a generalization "chemical reaction" between new and old knowledge.
- **Inspirations from the Brain: Dreaming-based Adversarial Compression (Generative Replay & Dreaming)**  
  The brain does not permanently back up raw data. During sleep (slow-wave and REM stages), the hippocampus sends **highly extracted, generative, and even noisy "hallucination" fragments (dreams)** to the neocortex. While receiving this "endogenous data," the neocortex realigns recent learning with ancient long-term representations through non-supervised adversarial processes. By reassembling patterns in high dimensions, facts that are closely related or unrelated are isolated and allocated to orthogonal (non-interfering) planes in low-dimensional space for settling. This is the true rule of intelligence for resisting forgetting and avoiding mode collapse.
- **Future Critical Solutions:**  
  This implies that ultimate large model engineering must have a "dual-system self-supervision/sleep mechanism." It needs to be divided into a dual-state lifecycle: an online inference service state (freezing underlying sparse slow parameters, heavily enabling efficient and easily-overwritten attention hidden states/structure buffers); and an **offline asynchronous (sleep) state**. Using the underlying system itself as a generative engine to simulate dream-level data streams, the tentative learning in buffers is transformed into slow assimilation within the underlying wide-area weights.

## Finding the Ultimate Breakthrough: Stepping Beyond the BP Myth

The ultimate shadow behind these three physical and mathematical absences is: **Standard Error Backpropagation (BP)** is essentially a mathematical global "God's perspective" scheduling algorithm (born only to find minima of first-order partial derivatives). It is inherently incompatible with neurodynamics that require timestamps, local causal properties, and spontaneous topological growth.

For weight-based continual learning to reach a singularity, the most revolutionary spark often lies not just in patching small engineering shortcomings but in jumping out of the current framework — transitioning into the realms of **Local Learning Rules (modern variants of Hebbian Learning)** and **Predictive Coding**.

Only when each neuron in a network is no longer a "puppet" of global loss reduction, but instead minimizes "local prediction error" through localized signal self-organization and possesses endogenous states for self-similar memory responses over time, can humanity truly acquire an electronic brain capable of living for 80 years while continuously "accumulating mind and civilization."
