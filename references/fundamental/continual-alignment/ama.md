Core Mechanism:
Adaptive Model Averaging. By performing smooth/elastic interpolation of weights between the RLHF pre-trained model and the post-reinforcement alignment model, it balances the trade-off between effective alignment and ability forgetting, providing robust generalization capabilities and a safety baseline.
