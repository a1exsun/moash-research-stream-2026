Source: Continual Learning of Large Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey

Core Mechanism:
Selective Language Modeling (SLM). By selectively processing language model tasks during Continual Pre-Training, it filters out low-quality or irrelevant token data, focusing computational resources on the memorization of high-value information.
