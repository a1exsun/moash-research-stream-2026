## Core Mechanism

LM2 introduces matrix-shaped latent memory slots into each layer, achieving structured intra-layer memory storage.

- Introduces matrix-shaped latent memory slots into every layer of the Transformer.
- Memory is organized in matrix form, providing a richer representation capability than vectors.
- Relevant to methods like Titans but with a different structure: LM2 emphasizes the structured storage of matrix slots.
- Memory slots in each layer are maintained independently, supporting information transfer and integration between levels.
