\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this comprehensive survey, we present an in-depth unified investigation of memory in both cognitive neuroscience and autonomous agents, covering definitions, functions, taxonomies, management, security, and future research directions. Although human-like memory mechanisms have proven to be highly beneficial for agents, existing work has yet to deeply draw upon the essence of memory mechanisms from brain science due to the gap between disciplines. We envision this survey as a step toward encouraging researchers to engage in cross-disciplinary collaboration and develop more robust agent memory systems.
